"""RD.B Privacy: hides names, phone numbers and email addresses before the post is saved.

Function: redact(text)

Input:
    text (str): a post in English.
    Sample: "We need water in Delmas 60. Call me, Marie Joseph, at 509-555-0199."

Output (dict):
    redacted_text (str): the text with each item replaced by [NAME], [PHONE] or [EMAIL].
                         Places stay, because responders need them.
    items_hidden (int): how many items were hidden.
    Sample: {"redacted_text": "We need water in Delmas 60. Call me, [NAME], at [PHONE].", "items_hidden": 2}

Raises ValueError if the LLM's answer can't be used.
Test it: python3 llm/privacy.py      Score it: python3 score.py privacy

    # 1. Ask the LLM to list what it finds, not to rewrite the text. Ask for JSON with one list for each
    #    key of PLACEHOLDERS, plus a list of places (towns, streets and buildings). Call
    #    ollama.generate(model="llama3.2", prompt=prompt, format="json", options={"num_predict": 500}),
    #    and read output.response with read_json. If a list is missing, ask again (up to 3 tries),
    #    then raise ValueError.
    # 2. Your code, not the LLM, replaces each listed item in the text with its PLACEHOLDERS value
    #    and counts the items it hides. Skip an item that is not a personal detail: a word in NOT_NAMES,
    #    a name that starts with a small letter, an email without an @, one letter, or a part of one of
    #    the places (or a long phrase that has one in it).
    #    A helper function such as should_hide(item, key, text, places) keeps this short.
    # 3. Return {"redacted_text": ..., "items_hidden": ...}.
